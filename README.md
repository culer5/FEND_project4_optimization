### What I changed:
* Minified the css/print.css
* Minified the css/style.css
* Inlined the css/print.css and css/style.css into the index.html folder
* Optimized all of the images in the images and views/images folders to help with load times
* Made a few changes in the views/style.css file to adjust the background pizzas
* Inlined the views/style.css into the pizza.html file
* Edited views/js/main.js to help stabilize page speed and reach 60fps

### Getting started

####Open the index.html file in your web browser.
* This page has a PageSpeed Insight score of 90 or better on mobile and desktop

#### Testing FPS
* Either navigate through the index.html page to the "Cam's Pizzeria" link or you can open the "views" folder, then open the pizza.html file inside of your web browser
* Open up the DevTools pane and scroll/click around on the page while recording its performance
